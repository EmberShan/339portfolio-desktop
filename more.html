        Allan Randall Freeon was a Philadelphian African-American Impressionism artist. He grew up in a middle-class
        family. His talent earned him a full scholarship to the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art. 
        During World War I, he served in the US army and after the war ended, he began teaching art in a Philadelphia public schools. 
        He believed that everyone could benefit from the study of art. During his teaching years, he became more interested in 
        the European Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. He, different from other African artists, believed that black artists should 
        develop their own independent art career and trends.

        Mary Stevenson Cassatt (1844-1926) was an American artist who lived in France. Her paintings 
        often focus on the social and private lives of women. Her mentor was Edgar Degas who was another 
        impressionism pioneer. Edgar invited her to join the group of Impressionists which was the only 
        official American group associated with Impressionism at that time. Edgar gave her criticism on her works 
        and techniques. She spent most of her late years in Grasse and died in 1926.
