        <!-- add a description of Monet here -->
        Oscar-Claude Monet (14 November 1840 – 5 December 1926) was a French artist 
        and the pioneer of Impressionism. <span class = "dots">...</span>
        <span class = "more-text hide">
          He was consistent in applying Impressionism to plein air landscape painting. 
          The word "Impressionism" is also derived from the title of one of his paintings.
          Monet grew up in Le Havre, Normandy. He started drawing at a very 
          early age. While his mother supported his painting career, his father 
          wanted him to a businessman. After his mother's death, Monet was sent to 
          live with his aunt Marie-Jeanne Lecadre.

        Impressionism related to a movement in Paris in 1860s. Impressionism received many criticism from other artists for its "unifnished" looks.

            Other artists ridiculed the movment by giving it the name "Impressionism" based on the title of one of Monet's paintings Sunrise.  
            Impressionists aim to capture the sensory effects of a scenery instead of painting realistically. Impressionists 
            find painting in plain air to be helpful for capturign their visual impressions. Other important Impressionist 
            artists include Pierre Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Berthe Morisot, 
            Armand Guillaumin, and Frédéric Bazille.

        <!-- differences between realism and impressionism -->
        To start simple, Impressionism paintings often contain no outlines. It is more focused on the artists'
      feelings about certain things like landscapes or people. <span class = "dots">...</span>
        <span class = "more-text hide">
          Impressionsm may not reflect the actual colors or shapes of the objects. In the image above, the left painting is realism while the right one is impressionism. 
          we can see that the left one has a clear outline of the sea, rocks, and waves. The foreground and background 
          are clearly separated. However, on the right, the painting is more "mushy": colors are mixing together and the actual 
          scenery is probably less vibrant that the painting.
